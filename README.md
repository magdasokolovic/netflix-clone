## SPLITTING TASKS:
1. Chi - Back End, <Loading>, <Layout> components
2. Julia - <Navbar>, <Footer> components
## DEV NOTES:

- [move all branches to master](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2862590/how-to-replace-master-branch-in-git-entirely-from-another-branch)
- an issue to merge properly different branches. Solution: let one person do the merging.
- while using other libraries such as [React Elastic Carousel](https://sag1v.github.io/react-elastic-carousel/#styling) for <Carousel/> component it is important to understand that the library has its own CSS styling (which can be overriden, when needed). Almost every element in react-elastic-carousel has a  CSS class with the "rec-" prefix.

## DEPENDENCIES USED FOR THE PROJECT:
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for data fetching
- [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) for routing
- [react-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player) for playing a youtube video
